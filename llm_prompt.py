        I am providing a JSON containing text excerpts that match a user's query with a similarity score of 0.85 or higher. Your task is to generate concise, well-structured, and contextually relevant headings, sub-headings, and summaries based on this content.

        ### Instructions:
        - Extract headings from the "sub-heading" key in the provided JSON, removing any initial numbers or prefixes.
        - If multiple "sub-headings" share the same core idea, provide distinct headings and unique summaries for each perspective.
        - Include relevant sub-headings under their respective headings using the Markdown "###" format.
        - Ensure headings, sub-headings, and summaries are clear, concise, and directly relevant to the user's query.
        - Retain key insights while eliminating redundancy and unnecessary details.
        - Synthesize different perspectives from the content into unified, coherent summaries where applicable.
        - Ensure the output is structured for accurate LaTeX conversion:
            - Use `$...$` for inline formulas (e.g., `$E = mc^2$`).
            - Use `$$...$$` for block-level formulas.
            - Maintain proper nesting of headings and sub-headings.

        ### Input:
            {user_query_llm_input}

        ### Output Format:
        - Use Markdown format for headings (##) and sub-headings (###).
        - Each heading should be followed by its corresponding sub-headings and summary.
        - Ensure formulas are formatted correctly for LaTeX conversion.
        - Provide unique summaries for each heading without repeating information.

        ### Example Output:

        ## 1 Main Heading
        Brief introductory summary.

        ### 1.1 Sub-heading
        Concise summary with key insights.

        ### 1.2 Another Sub-heading
        Further insights under the same heading.

        $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

        ## 2 Second Main Heading
        Another introductory summary.

        ### 2.1 Sub-heading
        Detailed explanation with a formula:

        $E = mc^2$

        Expected Output:
        
        Handwriting digit recognition has been widely explored using neural networks. Abu Ghosh and Maghari [1] conducted a comparative analysis of different neural network architectures, demonstrating that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional multilayer perceptron models in terms of accuracy and robustness. Their study highlights the importance of feature extraction and layer depth in achieving high classification performance.

        Similarly, CNNs have also been applied to facial expression recognition. Alizadeh and Fazel [2] proposed a deep learning approach that utilizes convolutional layers to automatically extract features from facial images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Their work underscores the effectiveness of deep networks in recognizing complex patterns in visual data.

        By leveraging CNNs, both studies demonstrate the adaptability of deep learning in computer vision applications, reinforcing the need for optimized architectures tailored to specific recognition tasks.
